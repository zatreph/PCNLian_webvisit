      <h1 class="text-primary">PCNLians triple in number within 5 years</h1>
      <p class="text-muted">For the last 5 years Philippine College of Northwestern Luzon has experienced and immense growth in the
         population. From 433 pc and alien in the 2020 tripling of this year to 1,294. PCNL's population has  gradually increased. 
         Such growth is truly observed last a. y. 2023 - 2024 , when the number of the freshmen or new enroll is went almost half of 
         the total population (527 out of 1098). The rising number is seen primarily as the result of the accessible and affordable 
         quality education the school delivers and numerous school promotional videos release online. Consistently, the majority belongs 
         to the Criminology Department, followed by Information Technology, Education, Business Administration and Accountancy
          Departments respectively. The passing rate on the board programs the institutions offers; BSA, 100% in may 2022; BSCrim, 
          66.7% in the July 2022; BSA,66.67% in the March 2024; is a contributing factor to such growth in the population. 
          The academe's ability to mold and produce passers truly motivates secondary graduates to enroll at PCNL and be just like 
          them in the future. The efforts of the admins staff and the faculty in doing career guidance in various secondary institution 
          as well as their credentials and stories are also seen as a strong forces pulling in new enrollees. As time goes by this rising
           data of PCNLian is expected to grow even higher specially when the new majors BSE Major in Mathematics and BSBA Major in 
           Marketing and the Engineering program are made available to enrollees. Soon in time PCNL will be known to many more not 
           only as one of the few institutions in the Agoo but as a institution of merit and growth serving "qualitas et excellentiam"</p>

        <p>Philippine College of Northwestern Luzon (PCNL) held a successful Tree Planting Activity in Macalva Sur, Agoo, La Union, on September 21, 2024.
Students from different departments—including BSA, BSBA, BSE, BEE, and BSIT—participated in the event as part of  their community service for their National Service Training Program (NSTP). Together with them were the school President, Atty. Ching, and NSTP instructors, Sir Bustamante and Sir Geneta.
Despite the rainy weather and the muddy, steep routes, the students remained enthusiastic and determined, completing the activity with great success.
The tree planting event offered students a valuable opportunity to actively contribute to environmental preservation. Each tree they planted represents a step toward a greener future, showing that collective efforts can make a lasting impact to our environment.</p>

      <div class="modal-body">
        <p>A greener, cleaner, and safer PCNL is what we have now after the success of the Clean-up Drive, led by the SSC officers last September 14, 2024.
Countless hands participated for the beautification of the institutions' environment and safeguarding the health of PCNLians through clean surroundings. Initiated by the SSC officers, they were accompanied by various departmental officers, two school organization advisers, Mr. Erwin Ching of SSC and Ms. Marian Jomalyn Aquino of PEN, and NSTP-CWTS Instructors, Mr. Antonio Bustamante, Mr. John Geneta and Mr. Rey Rosido. 
NSTP-CWTS students have also lend their hands in making the goal possible. NSTP-ROTC students  also came to help on the said activity after their formation at DMMMSU-SLUC.
This initiative is just the beginning of the numerous student and institution-centered programs of the SSC. May we all continue to be with them in creating a better learning environment and a safer home to all PCNLians.</p>
