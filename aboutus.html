      INSTITUTIONAL PROFILE OF PHILIPPINE COLLEGE OF NORTHWESTERN LUZON HISTORY The demand for

      from La Union and from the north and Western towns of Pangasinan, whose children are in elementary
      and secondary schools. After the organizational meeting of the incorporators, the organization
      came up with the name Philippine College of Northwestern Luzon (PCNL) with articles of
      incorporation and by-laws duly commission, approved Baguio by the Extension Securities 
      Office on andtheExchange 20th day of February 2007. All CHED requirements were prepared
      by the group including the province prospective courses to be offered namely Bachelor of
      Science in Business Administration (BSBA), Bachelor of Science in Accountancy (BSA), 
      Bachelor of Science in Secondary Elementary Education (BEE),and (BSE), Bachelor of Science
      in Information Technology (BSIT). While the institution is waiting for the approval of 
      Commission on Higher Education (CHED), the Board of Trustees composed of 9 members of 
      the 15 incorporators likewise preferred the Technical Education and Skills Development 
      authority (TESDA) requirements of offering short term courses. After the visit of TESDA

      court with a newly-constructed stage. In New Building, there are 2 classrooms,
